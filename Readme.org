*  I3 Helpers (i3h)

  A bunch of small wrappers around i3-msg using jq to get some
  shortcuts to i3 functionalities I use very often.

** Install

   I usually have ~/.local/bin/ in my $PATH, and installing is as simple
   as copying all files from ./i3h to there:

#+begin_src shell
cp -v ./i3h/* ~/.local/bin/ 
#+end_src

** Requirements
   
   Requires [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]].

** TODO IMPROVE README
