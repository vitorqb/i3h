*  I3 Helpers (i3h)

  A bunch of scripts mainly wrapping i3-msg I wrote over time to
  facilitate my life when scripting for i3h, or with some handy
  functionality like auto-typing common phrases.

  Can be handy for bash scripting for i3.

  Read the `--help` of a script to see what it does.

  Drop me a line if you are interested in more info.
